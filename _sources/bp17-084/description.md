## Refactoring to use standard building blocks

This Building Block documents the proposal in "EO Collection GeoJSON(-LD) Encoding"

The schemas have been updated to be consistent with current JSON schema drafts ( from draft-04)

Normative schemas for OGC FG-JSON have been used to replace copies of GeoJSON elements.

The original examples are referenced for testing purposes.

The JSON-LD context file is copied in situ and should be refactored to remove references to component building block elements.
